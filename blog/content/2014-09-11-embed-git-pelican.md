Summary: Embed git file content into pelican blog

Writing articles in github pages is nice, because you have github repository with all the nice features for document management, however sometimes it's not where I want my articles to reside. For instance, I want the articles about git to be in a separate `git` repository.

I have several solutions for this problem:

* I could duplicate the article. But I won't do this.

* I could store the articles as `gist` like this:

[gist:id=dc8b7c536d0fe9c7003f]

But I can't store a lot of related things in gist because that's the role of a real git repo.

* I could store the articles in the normal `git` repo, and embed it into the article in github page. I chose this approach for long articles. Like this:

<script src="http://gistit-minhhh.appspot.com/github/robertkrimen/gist-it-example/blob/master/example.js"></script>

There's already a nice tool to do this: [gist-it](https://github.com/minhhh/gist-it). Using it is really simple, just clone the repo and deploy it to an AppEngine instance.
The downside of this is it does not generate `html` code for `Markdown`.

* The best solution for me is to use a plugin for embedding git file into `pelican` like this:

[git:repo=minhhh/wiki,file=sample.md]
